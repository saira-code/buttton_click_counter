## ðŸ’¡ Reflection

**What I learned while making this app:**  
I learned how to handle click events in JavaScript and dynamically update HTML content.

**What feature I enjoyed building the most:**  
I enjoyed making the live count update instantly when the button is clicked.

**What I would add next if I had more time:**  
I would add persistent storage so the count stays even after refreshing the page.
